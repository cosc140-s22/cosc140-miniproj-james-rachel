Castle Finder uses Google Places API to dynamically fetch many relevant castles. The website is super flexible and can find at least a few relevant castles for most locations within a specified radius of 50km. The website also dynamically pulls and displays location reviews, photos, distance and rating for each castle. It includes a show, review and index page and has two forms. You can filter search results by the latter categeories using a dropdown form selector and write reviews using a one to many relationship. Previously found castles are displayed directly from the database rather than the API to save time.
